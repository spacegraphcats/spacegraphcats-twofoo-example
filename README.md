# spacegraphcats-twofoo-example

This is an example spacegraphcats project using some real data from
Shakya et al., 2015, to demonstrate a snakemake-based workflow for
spacegraphcats queries.

See https://github.com/spacegraphcats/spacegraphcats-dory-example for
what the various output files mean.

## Quickstart:

```
pip install spacegraphcats snakemake

snakemake
```
